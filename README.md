# PyCon Beginners Day

Welcome to PyConNove Beginners Day Tutorial. As you may already have guessed
by looking at the repo content, this tutorial is not only for mere beginners.

In fact, the material is organised in three different folders:

- [Beginner](./1. Beginner)
- [Intermediate](./2. Intermediate)
- [Data Science](./3 Data Science)

Please feel free to pick the group/folder you like the most.

## Note:

Before moving on, please take a look at the
[Installation Instructions](./installation.md) to correctly set up the
environment.

Once you are done, you only need to do one thing: **enjoy** :).
